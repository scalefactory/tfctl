= Releasing

This document is aimed at `tfctl` maintainers and describes the process of
releasing a new gem version.

== Process

* Smoke test in SF test accounts: https://github.com/scalefactory/tfctl-test
* Bump version in `lib/tfctl/version.rb`.
* Update `CHANGELOG.adoc`.
* Commit.
* Tag the release using format: vX.X.X and push the tag.

----
git tag vX.X.X
git push origin vX.X.X
----

* GitHub actions will build and release the gem and create a GitHub release automatically.
