== Overview

`tfctl` is a small Terraform wrapper for working with multi-account AWS
infrastructures where new accounts may be created dynamically and on-demand.

It discovers accounts by reading the AWS Organizations API, and can assign
Terraform resources to multiple accounts based on the organization hierarchy.
Resources can be assigned globally, based on organization unit or to individual
accounts.  It supports hierarchies of nested Organizational Units (OUs),
and helps keep your Terraform DRY.

The Scale Factory originally created tfctl to integrate Terraform with
https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/aws-landing-zone/[AWS Landing Zone] and
https://aws.amazon.com/controltower/[Control Tower] but should work with most
other ways of managing accounts in AWS Organizations.

== Project status

`tfctl` is an open source project published by The Scale Factory.

We currently consider this project to be maintained but we don't actively
develop new features.  We keep it security patched and ready for use in
production environments.

We’ll take a look at any issues or PRs you open and get back to you as soon as
we can. We don’t offer any formal SLA, but we’ll be checking on this project
periodically.

If your issue is urgent, you can flag it as such, and we’ll attempt to triage
appropriately, but we have paying customers who also have demands on our time.
If your business depends on this project and you have an urgent problem, then
you can talk to our sales team about paying us to support you.

== Features

* Discovers AWS accounts automatically.
* Automatically generates Terraform account configuration.
* Parallel execution across multiple accounts.
* Hierarchical configuration based on AWS Organization units structure.
* Supports per account configuration overrides for handling exceptions.
* Supports nested organization units.
* Terraform state tracking in S3 and locking in DynamoDB.
* Account targeting by OU path regular expressions.
* Automatic role assumption in target accounts.
* Works with CI/CD pipelines.

== Requirements

 * Terraform >= 0.12.29
 * Ruby >= 2.5
 * Accounts managed in AWS Organizations (by Landing Zone, Control Tower, some
   other means)

== Installation

To install the latest release from RubyGems run:

[source,shell]
----
gem install tfctl

== Running tfctl

You should run `tfctl` from the root of your project directory.  It will generate
Terraform configuration in `.tfctl/` (add this to your `.gitignore`).

Anatomy of a tfctl command:

[source,shell]
----
tfctl -c CONFIG_FILE TARGET_OPTIONS -- TERRAFORM_COMMAND
----

* `-c` specifies which tfctl config file to use (defaults to `tfctl.yaml` in
 current working directory if not set)
* `TARGET_OPTIONS` specifies which accounts to target.  This could be an individual
  account, a group of accounts in an organizational unit or all accounts.
* `TERRAFORM_COMMAND` will be passed to `terraform` along with any
  options.  See https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/index.html[Terraform
  commands] for details.

NOTE: You must have your AWS credentials configured before you run `tfctl`, or run
it using an AWS credentials helper such as
https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault[aws-vault].

=== Example commands

Show help:

[source,shell]
----
tfctl -h
----

Show merged configuration:

[source,shell]
----
tfctl -s
----

List all discovered accounts:

[source,shell]
----
tfctl --all -l
----

TIP: This can be narrowed down using targeting options and is a good way to
test what accounts match.

Run `terraform init` across all accounts:

[source,shell]
----
tfctl --all -- init
----

Plan Terraform across all accounts in the `test` OU:

[source,shell]
----
tfctl -o test -- plan
----

Plan Terraform in `live` accounts, assuming that `live` is a child OU in multiple
organization units:

[source,shell]
----
tfctl -o '.*/live' -- plan
----

Run a plan for an individual account:

[source,shell]
----
tfctl -a example-account - plan
----

Apply Terraform changes across all accounts:

[source,shell]
----
tfctl --all -- apply
----

Destroy Terraform-managed resources in all the `test` OU accounts:

[source,shell]
----
tfctl -o test -- destroy -auto-approve
----

Don't buffer the output:

[source,shell]
----
tfctl -a example-account -u -- plan
----

This will show output in real time.  Usually output is buffered and displayed
after the Terraform command finishes, to make it more readable when running
across multiple accounts in parallel.
